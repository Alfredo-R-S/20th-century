Data Visualization with Python: Building a Historical Network Analysis

Project Overview: Analytical Study and Visualization of 20th-Century International Relations

This project, commissioned by the Institute for Public Policy, presents an analytical overview and visualization of the interrelations between countries throughout the twentieth century. The goal is to identify and illustrate significant historical ties that have shaped global political dynamics. These insights are intended to support ongoing policy research and contribute to a deeper understanding of international trends and alliances over time.

Given the complex and often volatile nature of world politics during this era, the analysis draws from a broad range of historical data, including diplomatic alliances, conflicts, treaties, and trade relations. Emphasis is placed on uncovering patterns that reveal how global events influenced political alignment and international cooperation or tension.

To ensure efficiency and clarity in the delivery of this project, modern data analysis tools and scheduling platforms have been employed. The resulting visualizations are designed to communicate findings effectively to academic institutions, startups, and other organizations seeking contextualized historical data for broader research initiatives.

Freelance analysts increasingly play a vital role in translating complex data into accessible insights, and this project exemplifies the type of analytical and visualization work often required in such roles.
